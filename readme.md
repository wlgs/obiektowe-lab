# Object Oriented Programming course

This repository was made to maintain a project developed throughout each lab. Started from scratch - the goal was to make life simulation program - [I have made my own here!](https://github.com/wlgs/life-simulation)

Each tag in this repo is a certain checkpoint for a given lab.

Each lab requirements (or project info) can be seen [here](https://github.com/apohllo/obiektowe-lab).
